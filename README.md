# Tools Used:
 Python : The primary programming language used for data analysis and model development.

 Pandas : For data manipulation and preprocessing.

 NumPy : For numerical computations and array operations.

 Matplotlib & Seaborn : For data visualization and exploratory data analysis.

 Scikit-learn : For implementing machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random
   Forest Classifier, LightGBM).

 LightGBM : A gradient boosting framework used for building high-performance models.

 Jupyter Notebook : As the development environment for coding and documentation.


# Working Procedure:
 Data Loading and Exploration :
1. Loaded the dataset using pandas.
2. Performed initial data exploration to understand the structure, missing values, and basic
   statistics.
3. Visualized the distribution of features using histograms and scatter plots with Matplotlib
   and Seaborn.

 Data Preprocessing :
1. Handled missing values by imputation or removal where necessary.
2. Standardized or normalized numerical features to ensure uniformity in scale.
3. Encoded categorical variables if any were present.
4. Split the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
   
 Feature Engineering :
1. Created new features or transformed existing ones to improve model performance.
2. Selected relevant features using techniques like correlation analysis or feature importance
   scores.

 Model Building :
1. Implemented multiple machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Random
   Forest Classifier, Gradient Boosting Machines (using LightGBM) etc.|
2. Tuned hyperparameters using grid search or random search to optimize model
   performance.

 Model Evaluation :
1. Evaluated models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-
   AUC.
2. Compared the performance of different models to select the best-performing one.
3. Analyzed confusion matrices and ROC curves for deeper insights.
